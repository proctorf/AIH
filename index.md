## 🧠 Core Course Themes
- DH Methods: 🗺️ Mapping | 🕸️ Networks | 📖 Distant Reading  
- Programming: Python basics → VS Code with Copilot  
- Data Criticism: Ethics, aesthetics, and interpretation  
- AI & Humanities: Critical perspectives + practical tool use  

## 📌 Key Notes
- Early Python labs use beginner-friendly tools (Replit, local editors)  
- VS Code + Copilot introduced Week 6 for AI-assisted work  
- Final project must incorporate a method (text, map, or network) and an AI-assisted analysis step
